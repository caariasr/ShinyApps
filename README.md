# bigdata

Welcome to the github repository for Big Data Post-Module Assignment CADMS team

Instructions: 

1. Create a github account if you don't have one by going to www.github.com or downloading github desktop

2. In terminal/console/iterm2, go to a location of your preference and issue the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/caariasr/bigdata.git` 

Or you can got to File/Clone Repository in the github desktop

2. Get in that new folder with 

`cd bigdata`

In terminal/console/iterm2

3. Issue the following command 

`git checkout -b carlos` 

but instead of `carlos` use your name. Or got to Branc/New Branch in the github desktop and create a new one with your name.

4. Now You can now make edits to the markdown file. Test it in R studio and commit if everything works

5. Go back to console in your bigdata folder

6. Issue the following command 

`git commit -am "added changes to markdown file"`

The text inside the quotation marks can be changed. Or click in `commit to carlos` from the github desktop. Instead of carlos it should say the name of your branch, otherwise you need to switch to your branch before commiting. NEVER COMMIT TO MASTER. 

7. Issue the following command

`git push origin carlos` 

Intead of carlos use your own name. Or in desktop fter you make a commit, on the top it should be an arrow and next to it should say push.

8. Now you can go to https://github.com/caariasr/bigdata.git and make a pull request.
